Global climate change and the greenhouse effect is often a reocurring political subject. From 1722-2013, the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) has collected daily temperature measurements from uppsala, Sweden. This data will be used to show the distribution of the yearly average temperature in uppsala from 1723-2013. Further more, analysis of this data will provide a moving average of the yearly average temperature. The moving average will be fitted with a $a(x-1840)\cdot cos(bx)$ function, trying to se if the future temperature is not only increasing, but actually oscillating more violently correlated to the human development since the industrial revolution in 1840.
