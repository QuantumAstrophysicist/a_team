SMHI (Swedish Metrological and Hydrological Institute) measures the temperature on various locations every day. This data can be found in their website \cite{smhidata}. The temperatures are measured between one and three times per day. Several locations has datasets that started about 60 years ago (e.g. Lund), but the Uppsala dataset contains average daily temperatures since 1722. In this report we analyze this data in ROOT and present the results. These results are: the temperature of a given day, the warmest and coldest day of each year, the mean temperature of each year and the beginning of the seasons.
